\title{The Reverse Ising Problem}
\author{Isaac Martin}
\date{Summer 2023}
\maketitle
\section{Introduction and Terminology}
\begin{defn}
  Let $\Sigma = \{-1, +1\}$. An \textbf{Ising circuit} is a function $f:\Sigma^N \to \Sigma^M$ where $N$ and $M$ are finite subsets of $\bN$. For convenience we always assume $N = \{1,...,n\}$ and $M = \{n+1, ..., n+m\}$.
\end{defn}

\section{Hierarchical Clustering}

A choice of ``auxililary array'' can be thought of as a function $a:\Sigma^N \to \Sigma^A$ which assigns an auxiliary state to each input state. The collection of germs of this function partitions $\Sigma^N$ into subsets of inputs which share the same auxiliary state. To be clear, we're talking about the partition
\begin{align*}
  \{a^{-1}(\alpha)\}_{\alpha \in \Sigma^A}
\end{align*}
of input spin space. If the choice of auxiliary array $a$ makes the Ising circuit feasible, then we say $a$ solves the Ising circuit.

This simple observation motivates a simple question: \emph{can a partition of $\Sigma^N$ be found such that it matches the partition produced by some feasible auxiliary array using only the logic of the Ising circuit?} Producing such a partition is a clustering problem on input spinspace.

\section{Pseudo-boolean optimization and polynomial fitting}
A pseudo boolean function (PBF) is any function $f:\{0,1\}\to \bR$. It is a well known fact that any such PBF can be uniquely represented by a multilinear polynomial in $n$ variables [pseudo-boolean optimization Boros, Hammer]; that is, a polynomial
\begin{align*}
  g(x_1,...,x_n) = \sum_{S \subset [n]} a_S \prod_{j \in S}x_j
\end{align*}
with $a_S \in \bR$ which equals $f$ pointwise on $\{0,1\}^n$. To be clear, here $S$ iterates over all subsets of $[n] = \{1,...,n\}$.

It is another well-known fact that the optimization of any pseudo-boolean function can be reduced in polynomial time to an optimization problem on a quadratic polynomial. The original method for accomplishing this was first written by Rosenberg, and since then a reputable zoo of alternative algorithms have been introduced. Most methods share the same basic idea: reduce degree $\geq 3$ monomial terms appearing in the polynomial $g$ by introducing auxiliary variables subject to constraints.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:rosenberg-reduction}
  Let $f$ be a multilinear polynomial in $n$ variables. There exists an algorithm $\textsc{Reduce}$ which produces a multilinear polynomial $g$ in $n + a$ variables such that
  \begin{align*}
    \min_{(\bfx, \bfa) \in \bB^n \times \bB^a} g(\bfx, \bfa) = \min_{\bfx \in \bB^n} f(\bfx)
  \end{align*}
  and if $(\bfx, \bfa) = \arg\min_{(\bfx, \bfa) \in \bB^n \times \bB^a} g(\bfx, \bfa)$ then $\bfx = \arg\min_{\bfx \in \bB^n} f(\bfx).$
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  [Boros Hammer Pseudo Boolean Optimization 2002]
\end{proof}
We need a slightly stronger statement however.
\begin{thm}
  Let $f:\Sigma^N \to \Sigma^M$ be a circuit. Then there exists an Ising circuit with auxiliary spins given by Hamiltonian $H$ which solves $f$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  Fix $G = N \cup M$ and consider the hamming objective function $\operatorname{ham}:\Sigma^N\times \Sigma^M\to \bR$ defined
  \begin{align*}
    \operatorname{ham}(s,t) = d(t, f(s))
  \end{align*}
  where $d(t, f(s))$ is the Hamming distance between $t$ and the correct output $f(s)$. Then there exists some multilinear polynomial $g$ in $|G|$ variables which recovers $\operatorname{ham}$ pointwise. We now apply Rosenberg reduction to $g$ and set $H$ equal to the terminal quadratic polynomial we obtain. All that remains to show is that on any input level $s$ the output which minimizes $H$ is $f(s)$.

  Fix an input $s$ and suppose that the minimizer of $g^k(s, \cdot)$ has output coordinates $f(s)$. To obtain $g^{k+1}$ we replace some pair $x_ix_j$ by $x_{k+1}$ and add the expression $M(x_ix_j - 2x_ix_{k+1} - 2x_jx_{k+1} + 3x_{k+1})$. Observe that this expression is zero if $x_ix_j = x_{k+1}$ and is strictly positive otherwise. It follows that $g^k(\bfx) = g^{k+1}(\bfx, x_{k+1})$ if $x_{k+1} = x_ix_j$ and $g^k(\bfx) < g^{k+1}(\bfx, x_{k+1})$ if $x_{k+1} \neq x_ix_j$. Hence the minimizer of $g^{k+1}$ on input level $s$ also has the correct output coordinates, and inductively, we conclude that $H$ is an Ising Hamiltonian reproducing the circuit $f$.
\end{proof}
