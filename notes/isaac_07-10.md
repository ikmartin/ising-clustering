- Add neutralizability conditions to Andrew's continuous relaxation setup
- Fiona's work on Fourier Motzskin can produce relations neccessary for feasible auxiliaries to satisfy. Can she run FM on a reduced constraint set to quickly produce deductions which reduce the space of feasible auxiliaries? Can said constraint sets be chosen to strategically cut down on the space of auxiliary functions we need to check in augmented approach?
